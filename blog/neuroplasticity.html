        <h3>Neuroplasticity & Growth Mindset</h3>
        <h5>12 Sep 2023</h5>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>The principles of Neuroplasticity</h4>
        <p>
          Neuroplasticity is the phenomenon where neurons in our brain change
          and reorganise as we learn and ‘do’ overtime. Understanding the
          principles of neuroplasticity enables people to recognise that they
          fundamentally can change and learn new information on a biological
          level.
        </p>
        <h4>Engaging with Neuroplasticity for your benifit</h4>
        <p>
          Neuroplasticity also teaches us that repetitive practice strengthens
          the connections between neurons, thereby making you better / stronger
          at whatever you are learning. An individual might engage with the
          principles of neuroplasticity when learning new skills such as a
          musical instrument, by engaging principles such as “Practice makes
          perfect” an individual might be motivated to continue practising their
          new skill, resulting in improvement.
        </p>
        <h4>How do you increase your neuroplasticity?</h4>
        <p>
          Practice, Practice, Practice! Neuroplasticity is the ability for
          neurons to rewire over time, this is constantly happening, but can be
          sped up by continuing the same skill as often as possible!
        </p>
        <p>
          A resource that I found particularly useful for understanding
          neuroplasticity was this web page by
          <a
            href="https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-brain-plasticity-2794886"

        <h4>Why is a Growth Mindset relevant?</h4>
        <p>
          Having a strong growth mindset can speed up your learning process
          exponentially. It relates to increased motivation, increased focus,
          and increased memory related to learning. This obviously makes it very
          relevant during study at Dev Academy, because all of these traits will
          have a strong positive impact on your learning.
        </p>
        <h4>Exploring the Growth Mindset</h4>
        <p>
          I’ve always been relatively aware of the impact of a positive mindset
          towards learning on learning. My dad works at Otago University
          Wellington, a place where many of these kinds of ideas, and similar
          ideas are coming out. This exploration into Neuroplasticity and Growth
          mindset has however reminded me of some of these ideas and how
          important it is to have a positive perspective towards my learning.
        </p>
        <h4>Intergrating a Growth Mindset & my strategy</h4>
        <p>
          With these learnings and understandings, I will make sure to try and
          practice coding everyday, and remind myself to have a positive
          perspective on my learning, even if it is getting a bit dull or
          demotivating. I think also just knowing that neuroplasticity and
          growth mindset are factors that influence positive learning, will help
          me to stay more motivated and focussed on work.
