        <h3>My Learning Plan</h3>
        <h5>5 Sep 2023</h5>
        <br /><br />
        <p>
          The main way I will manage my workload during this program is to try
          and always stay at least slightly ahead of where we are meant to be in
          the workload. This helps me to motivate myself to continue to stay
          slightly ahead, and prevents stress and demotivation when I start
          falling behind. I find that when I am slowly falling behind in work,
          that I find it harder and slower to catch up, than if I was ahead, and
          wanted to complete more work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each day I will also make sure to get out of the house and get some
          exercise. It's easy to have a lazy morning and spend the afternoon and
          early evening studying, so I will make sure to put some time aside
          each morning to get some fresh air and exercise.
        </p>
        <p>
          I expect the facilitator team to clearly understand the content that
          we are learning so that we can get adequate help when needed, and of
          course, help us understand what we are doing wrong when we are having
          an issue.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the moment I don’t really have any other commitments other than
          studying for Dev Academy. During foundations, there is a period of 10
          days where I will be away down south, so I have planned with my
          facilitator that I will complete an extra week's worth of material in
          advance, so I am only a few days behind when I come back.
        </p>
        <h4>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h4>
        <p>
          At the moment, my long term career goal is to get into the Game
          Development Industry in Wellington. Obviously this is quite a specific
          goal, so I have challenged myself to try and get into general IT work,
          to build up a bit of experience and a portfolio, to make me more
          appealing to employers in the Game Dev industry. On the side of my
          shorter-term goal of getting into IT/programming, I’m developing my
          skills with 3d rendering and game programming to hopefully boost my
          knowledge in the area.
        </p>
        <h4>
          A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
          learning
        </h4>
        <p>
          A strength of my learning is that when I am enjoying myself, and
          stimulated, I can speed through large qualities or work relatively
          quickly. However the flip side of this can definitely be a weakness of
          mine. When I am completing work that I am already familiar with or
          don’t enjoy much, procrastination can often kick in! In these
          situations, I often struggle to find the motivation to complete the
          necessary task, and will work on it at a very sluggish pace.
        </p>
        <h4>
          What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
          developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
        </h4>
        <p>
          I would like to develop a strong understanding of
          Javascript/Typescript, and also the broader fundamentals of
          programming. With my previous experience with programming,
          particularly with games, I was entirely self taught (primarily through
          youtube!) and so I believe I missed a lot of base level understanding
          of how to teach myself effectively, best practices, and why something
          works the way it does. I would like to see Dev Academy teaching me
          some of this knowledge-gap.
