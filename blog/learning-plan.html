        <h3>Bootcamp Learning Plan</h3>
        <h5>28 Sep 2023</h5>
        <br />
        <h4>What is your long-term goal or career pathway?</h4>
        <p>
          Like my goal and career pathway in foundations, my long-term career
          goal is to get into the Game Development Industry in Wellington.
          Obviously, this is quite a specific goal, so at this stage, if I can
          get any general programming role to build up a bit of experience and a
          portfolio, that would be awesome.
        </p>
        <h4>
          What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in
          Bootcamp?
        </h4>
        <p>
          I think my strengths and limitations of learning during bootcamp are
          similar to what my strengths and limitations have been during
          foundations. I think bootcamp will be better for me, though. I'm a
          very social person, and I find in-person learning a lot more fun.
          This, in turn, makes me happier and, therefore, more motivated and
          faster at completing work. The downside of in-person learning is that
          I can sometimes be a bit slow to get out of bed! During bootcamp, I'll
          just need to make sure to keep a tight schedule so I'm not late for
          class.
        </p>
        <h4>
          What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp
          will be?
        </h4>
        <p>
          I'm not really sure. I've never spent as much time working on
          something as I will be during bootcamp, so I'm assuming I will run
          into challenges with the intensity of the course, but I'm excited
          about the intensity, and I think it will be a learning style that will
          suit me. Otherwise, my biggest non-technical challenge might be
          getting enough sleep before class and making sure to always show up on
          time.
        </p>
        <h4>Human skills I would like to see developed at Dev Academy</h4>
        <p>
          Teamwork is a big human skill that I would like to improve on. With my
          previous programming, I've seldom worked in a team and very rarely had
          to adapt my way of working to fit around other people. Learning
          effective teamwork, both for cooperating smoothly with people and
          being able to work around other people's style of working, I think
          will be very beneficial skills for me.
        </p>
        <h4>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h4>
        <p>
          I expect the bootcamp team to clearly understand the content we are
          covering during the bootcamp course so that they can properly help
          myself and the other students when we are struggling with what we are
          being taught.
        </p>
        <h4>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</h4>
        <p>
          If the help is related to understanding content that we are being
          taught, and if I am heavily struggling with a particular topic, I will
          make sure to request extra help from the bootcamp team and other
          people who understand the content better than myself. If the help I
          need is workload-related, I think my parents are very useful to talk
          with to gain insight and perspective into some different strategies I
          could maybe try to adopt to better get through the intense learning.
        </p>
        <h3>Foundations Learning Plan</h3>
        <h5>5 Sep 2023</h5>
        <br /><br />
        <p>
          The main way I will manage my workload during this program is to try
          and always stay at least slightly ahead of where we are meant to be in
          the workload. This helps me motivate myself to continue to stay
          slightly ahead and prevents stress and demotivation when I start
          falling behind. I find that when I am slowly falling behind in work, I
          find it harder and slower to catch up than if I was ahead and wanted
          to complete more work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each day I will also make sure to get out of the house and get some
          exercise. It's easy to have a lazy morning and spend the afternoon and
          early evening studying, so I will make sure to put some time aside
          each morning to get some fresh air and exercise.
        </p>
        <p>
          I expect the facilitator team to clearly understand the content that
          we are learning so that we can get adequate help when needed, and of
          course, help us understand what we are doing wrong when we are having
          an issue.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the moment, I don’t really have any other commitments other than
          studying for Dev Academy. During foundations, there is a period of 10
          days where I will be away down south, so I have planned with my
          facilitator that I will complete an extra week's worth of material in
          advance so I am only a few days behind when I come back.
        </p>
        <h4>What is your long-term goal or career pathway?</h4>
        <p>
          At the moment, my long-term career goal is to get into the Game
          Development Industry in Wellington. Obviously, this is quite a
          specific goal, so I have challenged myself to try and get into general
          IT work to build up a bit of experience and a portfolio to make me
          more appealing to employers in the Game Dev industry. On the side of
          my shorter-term goal of getting into IT/programming, I’m developing my
          skills with 3D rendering and game programming to hopefully boost my
          knowledge in the area.
        </p>
        <h4>
          A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
          learning
        </h4>
        <p>
          A strength of my learning is that when I am enjoying myself and
          stimulated, I can speed through large quantities of work relatively
          quickly. However, the flip side of this can definitely be a weakness
          of mine. When I am completing work that I am already familiar with or
          don’t enjoy much, procrastination can often kick in! In these
          situations, I often struggle to find the motivation to complete the
          necessary task and will work on it at a very sluggish pace.
        </p>
        <h4>
          What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
          developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
        </h4>
        <p>
          I would like to develop a strong understanding of
          Javascript/Typescript and also the broader fundamentals of
          programming. With my previous experience with programming,
          particularly with games, I was entirely self-taught (primarily through
          YouTube!), and so I believe I missed a lot of base-level understanding
          of how to teach myself effectively, best practices, and why something
          works the way it does. I would like to see Dev Academy teaching me
          some of this knowledge gap.
