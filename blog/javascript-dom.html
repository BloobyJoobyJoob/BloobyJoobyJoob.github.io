        <h3>Javascript & the DOM</h3>
        <h5>11 Sep 2023</h5>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS</h4>
        <p>
          Like HTML and CSS, Javascript is a langeuge that runs on web browsers.
          Unlike CSS which controls the look and design of a web page, and
          unlike HTML which describes the content and layout, Javascript
          controls the functionality of the website. HTML is like a recipe's
          ingredients list, containing all the necessary information. CSS is the
          presentation of the recipe, and Javascript is like the the written
          instructions on the recipe, that control the process of making the
          meal.
        </p>
        <h4>Control flow and Loops</h4>
        <p>
          Control flow refers to the order of instructions / steps in a computer
          program. If you think of control flow as in regular life, you could
          think of it like the process of waking up, getting ready for class or
          work, commuting there, working or studying, and then coming home etc.
          In programming loops are a way of repeating a certain operation or set
          of instructions in a consise way. Each weekday for many people is
          realativly similar, so if life was like a copmuter program, you could
          think of each day as part of a loop.
          <br />
          There are many kinds of loops in Javascript. Some examples of commons
          loops are shown below. In each example, the loops all log each array
          element to the console.

        />
        <br />
        <br />
        <h4>The DOM</h4>
        <p>
          The document object model (aka DOM) is a API interface that represents
          a webpage when it loads. It contains lots of information about the
          page, and enables different programming langeuges to interact with it
          easily. The DOM follows a tree like structure, where each node in the
          tree represents an object in the document. Many of these objects are
          often HTML elements, which makes using the DOM very convieniet for
          creating responsive webpages using a languege like Javascript.
          <br />
          In Javascript, here is an example of how you might access a HTML
          element of the id 'box' using the DOM.
        </p>

          class="blog-image"

        />
        <br />
        <br />
        <h4>Arrays & Objects</h4>
        <p>
          Accessing data from arrays and objects in JavaScript is very
          different. In an object, because objects contain singular organised
          data, is as simple as specifying what peice of data you want using a
          period (.).
          <br />
          <br />
          <img
            class="blog-image"
            src="../images/js-dom/objects.png"
            alt="Example of using the DOM in Javascript"
          />
          <br />
          Arrays on the other hand, can be a bit more complicated. Most of the
          time you have to index the array using two square brackets with the
          value inside being the index (position) of the data inside the array.
          This creates another problem though, as it means you have to know the
          correct index value to use to access the correct data inside the
          array. This is often solved by programmers by using a loop, to cycle
          <br />
          through the array to find the correct peice of data they need from it.
        </p>

        <br />
        <br />
        <h4>Functions</h4>
        <p>
          Functions are handy features in programming the help to segment code
          and make it more re-uasable. Functions (also called methods) normally
          cover a certain aspect of the program. This function can then be
          'called' anywhere in the scope as many times as need to execute that
          code.
