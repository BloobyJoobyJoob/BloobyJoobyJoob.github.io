        <h4>Te Whare Tapu Wha Wellbeing Plan</h4>
        <p>
          Te Whare Tapu Wha Maori wellbeing model created in 1984. It provides a
          unique perspective on health using 4 pillars or walls that hold up the
          whare of wellbeing. These pillars are;
          <li>
            <ul>
              Taha Tinana (physical wellbeing)
            </ul>
            <ul>
              Taha Hinengaro (emotional and mental wellbeing)
            </ul>
            <ul>
              Taha Wairua (spiritual wellbeing)
            </ul>
            <ul>
              Taha Whﾄ］au (friends & family wellbeing)
            </ul>
          </li>
        </p>
        <h4>taha tinana (physical wellbeing)</h4>
        <p>
          Asside from the obvious benifits of keeping a good physical health, I
          find that when I exercise, I sleep better and feel happier during the
          day. So far, I have made sure to keep a good phsyical health by
          exercising at the gym each day in the afternoon. This acts as a good
          way to take a break from my study, and a way of keeping fit. I often
          go for walks in the evening as well before bed.
        </p>
        <h4>Taha Hinengaro (emotional and mental wellbeing)</h4>
        <p>
          With regards to my emotional and mental wellbeing, I find that I often
          feel happier when my other pillars of wellbeing are upheld especially
          when it comes to Taha Whﾄ］au (friends & family wellbeing). I'm a very
          extroverted person, and find just interacting with people I am similar
          to be something the postivly effects my mental health.
        </p>
        <h4>Taha Wairua (spiritual wellbeing)</h4>
        <p>
          I'm a very un-spiritual person in general. My biggest weakness found
          by a personality test I took in Sprint 1 (or 2?) was infact
          spiritualily. I'm non religious, but I do have a strong interest in
          understanding I guess you could say 'spiritual questions.' (Meaning of
          life, what is counciousness, etc...). I guess this interest could fall
          into Taha Wairua, but I don't see it as an important aspect of my
          wellbeing.
        </p>
        <h4>Taha Whﾄ］au (family wellbeing)</h4>
        <p>
          Taha Whﾄ］au is one of the pillars I am more focussed on when it comes
          to my wellbeing. Given that Dev Academy is online, there isn't as many
          aspects of my life at the moment where my social battery gets
          fullfillment! At the moment, I really try to make plans with mates
          over the weekeneds, and often host get-togeathers with friends. I
          don't see much changing over my time during foundations, but I look
          foward to the in-person bootcamp where I can make some more
          connections with people.
