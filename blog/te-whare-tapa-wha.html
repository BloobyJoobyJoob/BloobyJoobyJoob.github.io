        <h4>Te Whare Tapu Wha Wellbeing Plan</h4>
        <p>
          Te Whare Tapu Wha is a Maori wellbeing model created in 1984. It
          provides a unique perspective on health using four pillars or walls
          that hold up the whare of wellbeing. These pillars are:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Taha Tinana (physical wellbeing)
            </li>
            <li>
              Taha Hinengaro (emotional and mental wellbeing)
            </li>
            <li>
              Taha Wairua (spiritual wellbeing)
            </li>
            <li>
              Taha Whﾄ］au (friends & family wellbeing)
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h4>Taha Tinana (Physical Wellbeing)</h4>
        <p>
          Aside from the obvious benefits of maintaining good physical health, I
          find that when I exercise, I sleep better and feel happier during the
          day. So far, I have made sure to maintain good physical health by
          exercising at the gym each day in the afternoon. This acts as a good
          way to take a break from my studies and stay fit. I also often go for
          walks in the evening before bed.
        </p>
        <h4>Taha Hinengaro (Emotional and Mental Wellbeing)</h4>
        <p>
          Concerning my emotional and mental wellbeing, I find that I often feel
          happier when my other pillars of wellbeing, especially Taha Whﾄ］au
          (friends & family wellbeing), are upheld. I'm a very extroverted
          person and find that interacting with people I am similar to positively
          affects my mental health.
        </p>
        <h4>Taha Wairua (Spiritual Wellbeing)</h4>
        <p>
          I'm generally not a very spiritual person. In fact, a personality test
          I took in Sprint 1 (or 2?) identified my biggest weakness as
          spirituality. I'm non-religious, but I do have a strong interest in
          understanding what you could call 'spiritual questions' (e.g., the
          meaning of life, consciousness, etc.). I guess this interest could fall
          into Taha Wairua, but I don't see it as an important aspect of my
          wellbeing.
        </p>
        <h4>Taha Whﾄ］au (Family Wellbeing)</h4>
        <p>
          Taha Whﾄ］au is one of the pillars I am more focused on when it comes
          to my wellbeing. Since Dev Academy is online, there aren't as many
          aspects of my life at the moment where my social battery gets
          fulfillment! Currently, I try to make plans with friends over the
          weekends and often host get-togethers with them. I don't see much
          changing during my time in foundations, but I look forward to the
          in-person boot camp where I can make more connections with people.
