        <h4>A Time I Was Blocked by a Problem</h4>
        <p>
          Recently, I had a few issues during the JavaScript Kata exercise,
          particularly in section 5 'builtin-methods.' One of these issues was
          with the capitalize challenge where I had to capitalize the first
          letter of every word in a sentence. To eventually solve this issue, I
          used a couple of problem-solving methods, including researching on the
          internet and using the console.log() method. I found the process of
          problem-solving a bit frustrating. It's still a relatively easy
          challenge, and I felt that I should be able to complete it in less
          time than I did. During this issue, I learned how important the
          internet is as a resource for solving future problems. It turns out
          that a lot of the time, it's a lot faster to research how something
          works instead of trying to figure it out yourself.
        </p>
        <h4>A Time I Elegantly Solved a Problem</h4>
        <p>
          Another problem I had during the Kata exercise was with the daBee
          challenge. Luckily, I didn't have too much of an issue with this
          challenge, but I remember at one point I was very confused about why
          my code wasn't working. I used the console.log() method to figure out
          the root of the issue, and after stepping through my code and reading
          it out loud methodically, I figured out that the problem was being
          caused by trying to remove array elements in the middle of a for loop.
          On the suggestion from the internet, I figured out that I could
          reverse the direction of the for loop to prevent this problem from
          occurring. Through this challenge, I learned to be careful when
          modifying array elements directly inside a loop.
        </p>
        <h4>My Confidence in Problem Solving Techniques</h4>
        <p>
          Of the various problem-solving techniques there are, I find that using
          console.log() and googling to be the easiest and most effective ways
          of debugging. I also find reading through my code out loud step by
          step (similar to the rubber ducky method) to be very helpful, and of
          course, asking my peers and coaches for support as well. ChatGPT, I
          have found, can also be a highly valuable tool in fixing issues, and I
          often use it to help try and solve my issues before I ask any
          real-life people.
        </p>
        <h4>A Time I Was Reluctant to Ask for Help</h4>
        <p>
          A time I was reluctant to ask for help was also during the 5th
          section, 'builtin-methods.' In the challenge 'Where are you,' I had to
          find and return the first object that "Scoopy" was hiding in. I was
          reluctant to ask for help because I knew the challenge was very
          simple, and I felt that what code I had written should be working. It
          turned out that I had simply made a spelling error, and that was what
          had caused my problem.
