        <h3>Problem Solving</h3>
        <h5>12 Sep 2023</h5>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>A time I was blocked by a problem</h4>
        <p>
          Recently, I had a few issues during the Javascript Kata exercise,
          particually in section 5 'builtin-methods.' One of these issues was
          with the capitalize challenge where I had to captalize the first
          letter of every word in a sentence. To eventually solve this issue I
          used a couple of problem solving methods including researching on the
          internet, and using the console.log() method. I found the process of
          problem solving a bit frustating. Its still a relativly easy
          challenge, and I felt that I should be able to complete it in less
          time than I did. During this issue, I learnt how important the
          internet is to use as a resource for solving future problems. It turns
          out that alot of the time its alot faster to research how something
          works instead of trying to figure it out yourself.
        </p>
        <h4>A time I elegantly solved a problem</h4>
        <p>
          Another problem I had during the Kata exercise was with the daBee
          challenge. Luckly, I didn't have too much issue with this challenge,
          but I remmember at one point I was very confused about why my code
          wasn't working. I used the console.log() method to figure out the root
          of the issue, and after stepping through my code and reading it out
          loud methodically, I figured out that the problem was being caused by
          trying to remove array elements in the middle of a for loop. On
          suggestion from the internet I figured out that I could reverse the
          direction of the for loop, to prevent this problem from occuring.
          Through this challenge, I learnt to be careful when modifying array
          elements directly inside a loop.
        </p>
        <h4>My confidence in problem solving techniques</h4>
        <p>
          Of the various problem solving techniques there are, I find that using
          console.log() and googling to be the easiest, and most effective way
          of debugging. I also find reading through my code outloud step by step
          (similar to the rubber ducky method) to be very helpful, and of course
          asking my peers and coaches for support as well. ChatGPT, I have found
          can also be a highly valuable tool in fixing issues, and I often use
          it to help try and solve my issue before I ask any real-life people.
        </p>
        <h4>A time I was reluctant to ask for help</h4>
        <p>
          A time I was reluctant to ask for help was also during the 5th section
          'builtin-methods.' In the challenge 'Where are you' I had to find and
          return the first object that "Scoopy" was hiding in. I was reluctant
          to ask for help, because I knew the challenge was very simple and I
          felt that I what code I had written should be working. It turned out
          that I had simply made a spelling issue and that was what had caused
          my problem.
