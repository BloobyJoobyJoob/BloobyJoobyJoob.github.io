Positioning in CSS. There are a few kinds of ways to position things in CSS. The
mains ones are, static, relative, absolute, and fixed positioning. The different
kinds of positioning influence how elements in an HTML file will be laid out in
the document. Static positioning. Static positioning is the simplelist deafault
way an element is positioned in HTML. It forces other static, and relative
elements to be placed next to it, rather than ontop, or overlapping it. Relative
positioning. Relative positioning acts in the same way as static positioning,
accept when an element is relative, you can use properties like 'top, bottom,
left right' to offset its position in the document. Any offset, relatively
positioned elements will not be effect the position of any other elements in the
document. This can lead to elements overlapping each other. Absolute
positioning. When an element's position is set to absolute, it will position
itself relative to its closest relative parent, or the root of the document. You
can offset an absolute element like you would a relative one. Fixed positioning
is the same as absolute accept the element is positioned relative to the browser
window.
