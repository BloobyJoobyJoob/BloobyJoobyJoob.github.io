        <h3>Emotional Intelligence</h3>

        <h4>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h4>
        <p>
          Emotional Intelligence has two facets. The first is the ability to
          understand and master one's own emotions. This can be demonstrated
          through patience, carefulness, and self-control. The second facet is
          the ability to understand others, to be sensitive, empathetic, and
          measured when interacting with people.
        </p>
        <h4>How is EQ different from IQ?</h4>
        <p>
          IQ describes general intelligence across multiple areas, particularly
          in technical skills. EQ (Emotional Intelligence) covers a more
          specific area of intelligence related to interpersonal skills, the
          ability to understand and relate to others, and self-awareness.
        </p>
        <h4>Why is EQ important?</h4>
        <p>
          EQ is very important. Having strong EQ can make you happier in life,
          help you form stronger relationships, enhance your employability, and
          enable you to be more content and resilient during challenging times.
          EQ is a valuable life skill that people can strengthen and improve for
          their benefit and the benefit of those around them.
