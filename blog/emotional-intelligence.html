        <h3>Emotional Intelligence</h3>
        <h5>6 Sep 2023</h5>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h4>
        <p>
          Emotional Intelligence has two facets to it. The first is the ability
          to understand, and become the master of oneâ€™s own emotions. This can
          be shown through patience, carefulness, and controlling of oneself and
          their ego. The second facet is the ability to understand others, and
          to be sensitive, empathetic, and measured when interacting with
          people.
        </p>
        <h4>How is EQ different to IQ?</h4>
        <p>
          IQ describes general intelligence across multiple areas, particularly
          with regards to technical skill. EQ (Emotional Intelligence) covers a
          more specific area of intelligence relating to people, and being able
          to understand and be measured with others, and thyself.
        </p>
        <h4>Why is EQ important?</h4>
        <p>
          EQ is very important. Having a strong EQ can make you happier in life,
          form stronger relationships, make you more employable, allow you to be
          more content and resilient when times are rough. EQ is a general life
          skill that people can strengthen and improve on for the better of
          them, and people around them.
