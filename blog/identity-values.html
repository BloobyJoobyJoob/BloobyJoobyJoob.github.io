        <h3>Identity, Value and Strengths</h3>
        <h5>5 Sep 2023</h5>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Some of my Strengths</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Judgement</li>
          <li>Love of Learning</li>
          <li>Forgiveness</li>
          <li>Kindness</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Some of my Weaknesses</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Bravery</li>
          <li>Self Regulation</li>
          <li>Prudence</li>
          <li>Spirituality</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I think my values fall around these skills and weaknesses, so that to
          some degree, I value things in life that complement my skills. Maybe
          that's a bit egotistical? For example, I am a firm believer in facts
          and science as a ground for evidence, aside from anecdotal, or
          personal instinct. This can be seen in my primary strength as
          ‘Judgement,’ and my primary weakness, ‘Spirituality.’ I also value
          honesty. (Kind of makes sense when one of my weaknesses is
          self-regulation) and general happiness.
        </p>
        <p>
          I can be a bit careless at times! A simple example of how this comes
          out is lack of filtering what I am saying, when I am talking. I
          recognise this as one of my larger weaknesses, and it is clear that it
          is an issue due to some of my weaknesses in the character profile
          being labelled as “Prudence, and Self Regulation.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Another weakness from my profile is Bravery. I am the opposite of
          argumentative (unless it's over texts lol). During conflict I find it
          alot easier and simpler to defuse a situation rather than try and
          solve it. This often means I find myself apologising, or accepting an
          apology very easily, even when it might not be due. A large part of
          this conflict diffusal, I think probably also comes from finding it
          difficult to articulate my emotions, and communicate how I feel about
          something. The general way it goes in my head is that I can’t stand up
          for myself easily, might as well let the other person win. I also feel
          like often it's better overall if I don’t respond in defence to what
          someone is saying, in a way to keep it easy with them.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss
          how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision
          you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
        </h4>
        <p>
          A while ago when I had recently started a position at a cafe, I had
          spent the full night out with friends for a birthday. I received a
          call that morning from the cafe asking if I could come in, because
          they had had a couple people call in sick. Despite the fact that I
          hadn’t actually slept that night, and I hadn’t been rostered on to
          work, I decided to come in, partly to help relieve the stress there,
          but also to show my commitment to the role I had just started. In this
          situation, I was obviously valuing commitment to the cafe over my own
          well being for the day.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced
          your values and identity.
        </h4>
        <p>
          I think my objective view and Judgement of stuff has been influenced
          by my parents, and how they operate. Mum mum works in Health
          Management, and my Dad in Education and Media at Otago University,
          Wellington. Both departments where they work make heavy use of
          statistics and science as ways of making life better for people. This
          scientific approach to life is something that I have probably
          inherited sort of unconsciously, in the way I do things as well.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
          learning journey.
        </h4>
        <p>
          ‘Love of Learning’ is obviously a very convenient skill to have when
          learning something. For programming specifically, I think being able
          to ‘Judge’ a problem objectively can make it easier to solve. Teamwork
          was also a member that was high up on my list of strengths.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
          development. How might these affect your learning journey?
        </h4>
        <p>
          Self regulation, and Prudence can sometimes make it difficult for some
          people to work with me. Offending someone by accident, or saying
          something out of pocket can obviously be jarring to people, and I do
          my best to avoid these situations, but they still seem to happen every
          once and a while.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
          others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
          tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on
          what other strategies you would try now and why.
        </h4>
        <p>
          Currently I am developing (programming) a computer game on the side
          with a friend of mine (creating game art). A slight tension we have,
          is that he can be quite inconsistent with when he works on the game.
          Obviously working on the game is fully voluntary, however it makes it
          difficult for me, when I’m trying to plan around when his assets will
          be finished. It’s a bit personal, but the best thing we have that
          makes working on the project easier is communication. Every day we are
          updating each other with what work we have done, what we will be
          doing, and how much time we will spend on the project in the next
          while. This communication between us is obviously vital, but for this
          tension specifically, it allows us to get a clear expectation of what
          work on the game will be done when.
