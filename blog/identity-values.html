        <h3>Identity, Values, and Strengths</h3>
        <h5>September 5, 2023</h5>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>Some of My Strengths</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Judgment</li>
          <li>Love of Learning</li>
          <li>Forgiveness</li>
          <li>Kindness</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Some of My Weaknesses</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Bravery</li>
          <li>Self-Regulation</li>
          <li>Prudence</li>
          <li>Spirituality</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I think my values align with these strengths and weaknesses, so to
          some degree, I value things in life that complement my skills. Maybe
          that's a bit egotistical? For example, I am a firm believer in facts
          and science as a basis for evidence, aside from anecdotal or personal
          instinct. This can be seen in my primary strength as 'Judgment' and my
          primary weakness, 'Spirituality.' I also value honesty (which makes
          sense when one of my weaknesses is self-regulation) and general
          happiness.
        </p>
        <p>
          I can be a bit careless at times! A simple example of how this comes
          out is a lack of filtering what I am saying when I am talking. I
          recognize this as one of my larger weaknesses, and it is clear that it
          is an issue due to some of my weaknesses in the character profile
          labeled as "Prudence" and "Self-Regulation."
        </p>
        <p>
          Another weakness from my profile is "Bravery." I am the opposite of
          argumentative (unless it's over texts lol). During conflict, I find it
          a lot easier and simpler to defuse a situation rather than try to
          solve it. This often means I find myself apologizing or accepting an
          apology very easily, even when it might not be due. A large part of
          this conflict diffusal, I think, probably also comes from finding it
          difficult to articulate my emotions and communicate how I feel about
          something. The general way it goes in my head is that I can't stand up
          for myself easily, so I might as well let the other person win. I also
          feel like often it's better overall if I don't respond in defense to
          what someone is saying as a way to keep things easy with them.

          Explain a Situation Where You Have Made an Ethical Decision. Discuss
          How You Weighed Up the Values Involved in That Decision, the Decision
          You Made, and How You Reflect on the Decision Now.
        </h4>
        <p>
          A while ago when I had recently started a position at a cafe, I had
          spent the entire night out with friends for a birthday. I received a
          call that morning from the cafe asking if I could come in because they
          had had a couple of people call in sick. Despite the fact that I
          hadn't actually slept that night and I hadn't been rostered on to
          work, I decided to come in, partly to help relieve the stress there,
          but also to show my commitment to the role I had just started. In this
          situation, I was obviously valuing commitment to the cafe over my own
          well-being for the day.

        <h4>
          Describe How Your Culture and the People Around You Have Influenced
          Your Values and Identity.
        </h4>
        <p>
          I think my objective view and judgment of things have been influenced
          by my parents and how they operate. My mom works in Health Management,
          and my Dad in Education and Media at Otago University, Wellington.
          Both departments where they work make heavy use of statistics and
          science as ways of making life better for people. This scientific
          approach to life is something that I have probably inherited
          unconsciously in the way I do things as well.

        <h4>
          Identify Your Strengths and How They Will Support You During Your
          Learning Journey.
        </h4>
        <p>
          'Love of Learning' is obviously a very convenient skill to have when
          learning something. For programming specifically, I think being able
          to 'Judge' a problem objectively can make it easier to solve. Teamwork
          was also a member that was high up on my list of strengths.

        <h4>
          Evaluate Your Limitations in Terms of Your Learning and Career
          Development. How Might These Affect Your Learning Journey?
        </h4>
        <p>
          Self-regulation and Prudence can sometimes make it difficult for some
          people to work with me. Offending someone by accident or saying
          something out of pocket can obviously be jarring to people, and I do
          my best to avoid these situations, but they still seem to happen every
          once in a while.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Share an Example of When You Were Trying to Work Productively With
          Others, But There Was Resistance or Tension
        </h4>
        <p>
          Currently, I am developing (programming) a computer game on the side
          with a friend of mine (creating game art). A slight tension we have is
          that he can be quite inconsistent with when he works on the game.
          Obviously, working on the game is fully voluntary, but it makes it
          difficult for me when I'm trying to plan around when his assets will
          be finished. It's a bit personal, but the best thing we have that
          makes working on the project easier is communication. Every day we are
          updating each other with what work we have done, what we will be
          doing, and how much time we will spend on the project in the next
          while. This communication between us is obviously vital, but for this
          tension specifically, it allows us to get a clear expectation of what
          work on the game will be done when.
