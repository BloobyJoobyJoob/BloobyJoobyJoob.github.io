        <h4>Learning about Myself and Ego through Core Learning</h4>
        <p>
          During the core material of Foundations, I have learned a few
          different things about myself and my ego. I think most of the learning
          hasn't actually come from working through the core material or writing
          down reflections about it. Instead, much of my learning has come from
          thinking about the core skills and ideas in my own time as I go about
          life and considering their importance in programming, learning, and
          life in general. This probably means that a fair chunk of what I have
          learned from the core material isn't properly documented in this blog
          or in my sprint reflections.
        </p>
        <p>
          By participating in the core material of the Foundations course, I
          have gained a deeper understanding of myself on a fundamental level.
          This includes a deeper understanding of what I do and don't value, my
          strengths as a person, and weaknesses that impact me negatively. I
          have also come to recognize times when I am and aren't emotionally
          intelligent, and I think I feel just a bit more self-aware in general.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Role of Values, Empathy, and Self-awareness in Learning and
          Programming
        </h4>
        <p>
          Understanding empathy, values, and self-awareness is important in
          learning and programming, particularly for the social interaction side
          of things. A programmer has little use to a company if they aren't
          able to work in a team, and many of these ideas are important facets
          to understand when working with people.
        </p>
        <h4>What Has Surprised Me the Most About the Core Learning</h4>
        <p>
          I think the amount of time I have spent thinking about some of the
          ideas outlined in the core material and the impact it has had on the
          way I see myself and my social interactions with other people has been
          surprising to me. I don't really enjoy the core material of the course
          a lot, but I'm surprised by how I've still reacted to it as much as I
          have.
        </p>
        <h4>Most Challenging Aspects of the Core Learning</h4>
        <p>
          For me, a challenging aspect of the core learning was recognizing how
          important it is to learn from and apply these ideas. As I've said, I
          haven't particularly enjoyed the core material, so it's been hard to
          find a reason why I should put effort into it.
        </p>
        <h4>Why I Think Dev Academy Spends Time Focusing on Core Learning</h4>
        <p>
          A large proportion of programmers are very talented and smart at what
          they do. It is clear that it would be hard for students with only 5
          months of study to compete with them. Having strong core skills gives
          us (as Dev Academy students) an edge over other programmers who might
          not be as strong communicators. Additionally, core skills are
          important skills to have for learning and life.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Does the Time You Spent Studying Core Learning Here Feel Like a Waste
          of Time? Should You Have Just Used That Time to Practice Programming
          Instead? Justify Your Answer.
        </h4>
        <p>
          Personally, despite what I've said previously, I do feel like some of
          the core learning and reflecting was a bit overdone. I recognize the
          importance of it, but I don't think it was necessary to have it in the
          curriculum to such a strong degree. Part of why I say this is because
          I think that not all of the techniques would work for everyone
          (meditation, reflection, etc.), and I think more trust can be given to
          students to learn from the core material and make changes to adapt its
          ideas in a way that suits them.
